<h1>Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) Award Recipients Power the Open Science Grid</h1>

CC* award recipients provide a termendous value to the Open Science Grid. In 2020 campuses with a CC* award contributed over https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/d/000000074/gracc-home 292 millon core hours in the support of research. This contribution supported over 186 science research projects.These projects encompassed 
COVID-19 research to 
virtual screensing for pain relief compounds to l
ight production in heavy-ion collisions 
genomic tools to understand the evolutionary process of marine invasion
Network Resource Abstraction and Optimization for Large-Scale Scientific Workflow


The National Science (NSF) Foundation supports Open Science Grid 2021The National Science Foundation funds the Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) program (NSF 21-528). (Link to https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504748) 
This program invests in coordinated campus-level networking and cyberinfrastructure improvements, innovation, integration, and engineering for science applications and distributed research projects. Learning and workforce development (LWD) in cyberinfrastructure is explicitly addressed in the program. Science-driven requirements are the primary motivation for any proposed activity.
