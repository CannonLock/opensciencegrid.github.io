<h1>Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) Award Recipients Power the Open Science Grid</h1>

CC* award recipients provide a termendous value to the Open Science Grid in support of scientific research. In 2020 campuses with a CC* award contributed over <a href="https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/d/000000074/gracc-home" target="_blank"> <b>292 millon core hours to researchers using distributed high throughput computing (dHTC).<b></a> These campus cyberinfrastructures supported over 186 scientific research projects in fields of study such as medical sciences, evolutionary sciences, bio statistics, physics and many more. This campus support thoughout the United States contributed to the advancement of science.

The type of inquiry ranged broadly; a small sampling includes:
- COVID-19 research  
- virtual screensing for pain relief compounds
- light production in heavy-ion collisions 
- genomic tools to understand the evolutionary process of marine invasion
- network optimization for large-scale scientific workflow

The map above shows the CC* campusus contributing to the Open Science Grid that have their compute entry point with the OSG in place. (Additional campuses  onboarding to the OSG are not displayed). The OSG team actively works with campuses to integrate smoothly campuses into the OSG. 

<h2>The CC* Program</h2>
The National Science (NSF) Foundation supports the Open Science Grid and campuses that contribute resources to it. For 2021 the National Science Foundation funds the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504748" target="_blank"> Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) program (NSF 21-528).</a>
This program invests in coordinated campus-level networking and cyberinfrastructure improvements, innovation, integration, and engineering for science applications and distributed research projects. Learning and workforce development (LWD) in cyberinfrastructure is explicitly addressed in the program. Science-driven requirements are the primary motivation for any proposed activity.

**Upcoming Deadlines: March 1, 2021; October 11, 2021** 

The NSF supports awards in 5 program areas:
>- 	Data-Driven Networking Infrastructure for the Campus and Researcher awards will be supported at up to $500,000 total for up to 2 years;
>- 	Regional Connectivity for Small Institutions of Higher Education awards will be supported at up to $1,000,000 total for up to 2 years;
>- 	Network Integration and Applied Innovation awards will be supported at up to $1,000,000 total for up to 2 years; 
>- 	Campus Computing and the Computing Continuum awards will be supported at up to $400,000 total for up to 2 years; and
>- 	Planning Grants and CI-Research Alignment awards will be supported for up to $200,000 total for up to two years.

<h2>OSG Can Help with Your CC* Proposal</h2>

The Open Science Grid <a href="https://path-cc.io/" target="_blank"> " target="_blank">(as part of the Partnership to Advance Throughput Computing (PATh)</a>, has significant experience working with CC* applicants and awardees, offering letters of support and consulting for:
>- bringing the power of the OSG to YOUR researchers
>- gathering science drivers and planning local computing resources or
>- CC*-required resource sharing for the Campus Compute category, and other options for integrating with OSG

In the most recent call for proposals <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504748" target="_blank">(NSF 21-528)</a>, joining the OSG is mentioned as a potential path to sharing resources with the wider research community:
Proposals are required to commit to a minimum of 20% shared time on the cluster and describe their approach to making the cluster available as a shared resource external to the campus, [...] One possible approach to implementing such a federated distributed computing solution is joining a multi-campus or national federated system such as the Open Science Grid.
