<h1>Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) Award Recipients Power the Open Science Grid</h1>

CC* award recipients provide a termendous value to the Open Science Grid. In 2020 campuses with a CC* award campuses contributed over <a href="https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/d/000000074/gracc-home" target="_blank"> 292 millon core hours </a> in the support of research. This campus cyber infrastructe supported over 186 science research projects in many fields of study such as medical sciences, evolutionary sciences, bio statistics and physics. These projects included:
*COVID-19 research  
*virtual screensing for pain relief compounds to l
*ight production in heavy-ion collisions 
*genomic tools to understand the evolutionary process of marine invasion
*network Resource Abstraction and Optimization for Large-Scale Scientific Workflow

The map above shows the CC* campusus contributing to the Open Science Grid that have their compute entry point in place. (Additional campuses are onboarding to the OSG). 

<h2>The CC* Program</h2>
The National Science (NSF) Foundation supports the Open Science Grid and campuses that contribute resources to it. For 2021 the National Science Foundation funds the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504748" target="_blank"> Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) program (NSF 21-528).</a>
This program invests in coordinated campus-level networking and cyberinfrastructure improvements, innovation, integration, and engineering for science applications and distributed research projects. Learning and workforce development (LWD) in cyberinfrastructure is explicitly addressed in the program. Science-driven requirements are the primary motivation for any proposed activity.

***Upcoming Deadlines: March 1, 2021; October 11, 

The NSF supports awards in 5 program areas:
>*1.	Data-Driven Networking Infrastructure for the Campus and Researcher awards will be supported at up to $500,000 total for up to 2 years;
>*2.	Regional Connectivity for Small Institutions of Higher Education awards will be supported at up to $1,000,000 total for up to 2 years;
>*3.	Network Integration and Applied Innovation awards will be supported at up to $1,000,000 total for up to 2 years; 
>*4.	Campus Computing and the Computing Continuum awards will be supported at up to $400,000 total for up to 2 years; and
>*5.	Planning Grants and CI-Research Alignment awards will be supported for up to $200,000 total for up to two years.

<h2>OSG Can Help with your CC* Proposal</h2>

The Open Science Grid (as part of the Partnership to Advance Throughput Computing (PATh), has significant experience working with CC* applicants and awardees, offering letters of support and consulting for:
*bringing the power of the OSG to YOUR researchers
*gathering science drivers and planning local computing resources or
*CC*-required resource sharing for the Campus Compute category, and other options for integrating with OSG

In the most recent call for proposals (NSF 21-528), joining the OSG is mentioned as a potential path to sharing resources with the wider research community:
Proposals are required to commit to a minimum of 20% shared time on the cluster and describe their approach to making the cluster available as a shared resource external to the campus, [...] One possible approach to implementing such a federated distributed computing solution is joining a multi-campus or national federated system such as the Open Science Grid.

Additionally, the below have pre-existing non-CC* CEs, and just don't have their 2020 CC* award clusters running, yet:
- New Mexico State University
- Portland State University
- Southern Illinois University

I just heard from NMSU that their CC* hardware is already implemented in an existing cluster (cc'd Derek on the ticket so he can see their reply). That will be one that we can already flag in topology (either the Discovery or AggieGrid cluster, and I think it's going to be Discovery), so they'll show up on the map!
