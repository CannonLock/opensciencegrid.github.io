title: Member Organizations
---

The OSG Consortium builds and operates the OSG. Consortium members contribute effort and resources to the common
infrastructure, with the goal of giving scientists from many fields access to shared resources worldwide.

The [Council](https://opensciencegrid.org/council/) governs the consortium ensuring that the OSG benefits the scientific
mission of its stakeholders.

The [Executive Team](https://opensciencegrid.org/management/) manages the OSG project, which is organized into technical
team areas.

The OSG is made up of Member Organizations who register with the OSG Operations Center and works with many Partner
Organizations.

Joining the OSG 
=====================

OSG brings together many organizations for contracted or opportunistic sharing of resources. If you are not already part of a organization utiziing the OSG, you can join the OSG via [OSGConnect](http://osgconnect.net/). 

OSGConnect also welcomes any researcher affiliated with U.S. institutions and funded by U.S. funding agencies! If you don’t know what organization you belong to or should belong to, please contact [OSG Support](mailto:help@opensciencegrid.org)
for help.

Use of Resources and User Support 
=====================

Use of resources at a member site is determined by a combination of the site’s local policies and the user's policies.
Many organizations in the OSG support the specific requirements of their users with their own facilitation and support team. Additionally, some provide dedicated resources to the OSG that provide preferred access to their members. Some organizations provide a problem specific user interface to their members.

The OSG assumes that each user is preferably supported by their membership organization.
Each group is expected to register with the OSG and provide support for their members.
OSG support is maintained through an organization representative.
