title: Extra Support for COVID-19 Research

OSG Support for COVID-19 Research
=================================

Like many others in the research computing community, OSG is helping to organize
extra resources to be made available to COVID-19 research!  These resources include:

- **Consultation and facilitation** for quickly scaling up and automating workflows.
- **Expertise** on using high throughput computing for maximizing research throughput.
- **Access to computing capacity** through the [OSG Connect](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/home)
  service which provides a batch system submit environment based on HTCondor.  The OSG aggregates
  about 100 clusters across the US and COVID-19 research could access tens of thousands of cores
  through this mechanism.  The OSG also provides a CDN for distributing data to jobs.

Many COVID-19 researchers access OSG through the Open Science Pool (e.g., the "`osg` VO").
Any computing resource provider supporting this organization is likely already providing hours
to support COVID-19.  If you would like to provide addition resources _exclusive_ for COVID-19,
[instructions are available](https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/compute-element/covid-19/).

To see current COVID-19 activities on OSG, see our dedicated
[COVID-19 accounting page](https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/covid-19-research?orgId=1).

Please contact us at <mailto:help@opensciencegrid.org> if your research group could benefit
from computing resources or consulting related to COVID-19.

Other Activities
----------------

-   OSG participates in the [COVID-19 HPC consortium](https://covid19-hpc-consortium.org/),
    a broad consortium of industry, academia, and national labs to make a diverse set of
    computing resources available for research.  The COVID-19 HPC consortium meets daily
    to review requests from researchers.
-   As part of [IRIS-HEP](https://iris-hep.org), [Science Responds](https://science-responds.org/) is a broad COVID-19
    response effort from the scientific community.
-   Trusted CI, NSF CoE Pilot, and the Science Gateways Community Institute are offering priority help to
    [projects tackling COVID-19](https://sciencegateways.org/-/trusted-ci-nsf-ci-coe-pilot-and-sgci-offering-priority-help-to-projects-tackling-covid-19)
-   OSG is participating in the [WLCG COVID-19 task force](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LCG/WLCGresourcesForCOVID-19research)
    (and broadly with computing organizations in Europe) to make LHC resources available to COVID-19 research.
-   OSG and EGI are joining forces to commit specialized technical support, specialized simulation tools, and compute
    and storage resources, to accelerate progress on [COVID-19 research]((https://www.egi.eu/egi-call-for-covid-19-research-projects/))
