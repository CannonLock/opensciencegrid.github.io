title: Extra Support for COVID-19 Research

OSG Support for COVID-19 Research
=================================

Like many others in the research computing community, OSG is helping to organize
extra resources to be made available to COVID-19 research!

Many COVID-19 researchers access OSG through the Open Science Pool (e.g., the "`osg` VO").
Any computing resource provider supporting this organization is likely already providing hours
to support COVID-19.  If you would like to provide addition resources _exclusive_ for COVID-19,
[instructions are available](https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/compute-element/covid-19/).

To see current COVID-19 activities on OSG, see our dedicated
[COVID-19 accounting page](https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/covid-19-research?orgId=1).

Please contact us at <mailto:help@opensciencegrid.org> if your research group could benefit
from computing resources or consulting related to COVID-19.

Other Activities
================

-   OSG participates in the [COVID-19 HPC consortium](https://covid19-hpc-consortium.org/),
    a broad consortium of industry, academia, and national labs to make a diverse set of
    computing resources available for research.  The COVID-19 HPC consortium meets daily
    to review requests from researchers.
-   [Science Responds](https://science-responds.org/) a broader COVID-19 response effort
    from the scientific community.
-   OSG is participating in the WLCG COVID-19 task force (and broadly with computing
    organizations in Europe) to make LHC resources available to COVID-19 research.
