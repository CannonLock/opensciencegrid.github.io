May 5 dHTC Campus Cyberinfrastructure Hackathon, 2 - 5 pm EST
Due to popular demand, we are holding our first dHTC Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CI) Hackathon offered by the Partnership to Advance Throughput Computing (PATh). All CI staff are invited to attend.
We’ll provide live help with preparing a cluster for resource-sharing through the OSG. Areas covered include:
batch system configurations 
configuring worker nodes
setting up a local or OSG Hosted CE, and
implementing OSG data caching.
While there is no fee, registration and completion of a brief survey is required for participants to receive virtual hackathon room details via email.  
Prerequisites for Participation
You know that you want to share resources into the OSG or are already in the process of sharing.
You have reviewed the written documentation on your area of focus. (See our documentation: https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/ )
You’ve completed the registration and survey indicating areas you’d like for help.
Topics Included on Registration Survey
When you register, we are asking you to complete a brief survey so we know your area of interest and we have OSG experts on those topics available to provide live support.  The survey covers:
Worker node configurations (CVMFS, Singularity, HTTP transfer)
Setting up a local OSG data cache (to better handle network traffic from incoming OSG jobs)
Deciding local batch system policy for OSG jobs (e.g., backfill)
OSG-hosted CE configuration or operation
Installation, configuration, and registration of a self-hosted CE
Sharing resources organized via Kubernetes
Troubleshooting a specific issue. (If applicable,  select ‘Other’ below, and note the OSG support ticket number.)
Other (Topics not listed above such as help with local scheduler configuration for non-OSG or  setting up an access point to submit jobs into OSG). Please include a description. 
I’m not sure, so I might benefit from discussing ahead of time. Please contact me.
